# SmartDrive Alert System

_A cutting-edge solution to enhance road safety by monitoring driver stress and fatigue levels to prevent accidents._

</header>

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem

**Why Road Safety Matters:** Road accidents are a global crisis, with over 1.19 million fatalities annually (WHO, 2019). Driver fatigue, distraction, and stress are major contributors to these accidents, impairing decision-making and increasing the risk of collisions.

**What is the SmartDrive Alert System?**: The SmartDrive Alert System is an innovative device designed to monitor heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, such as Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) and Standard Deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), to detect stress levels. When abnormal HRV patterns are detected, the system alerts drivers through sound and light notifications, helping them take corrective actions to avoid accidents.

## Step 2: Core Features of the SmartDrive Alert System

1. **HRV Monitoring and Analysis**:
   - Collects real-time HRV data.
   - Analyzes parameters like RMSSD and SDNN to assess stress levels.

2. **Driver Alerts**:
   - Provides immediate warnings through sound and light notifications when stress is detected.

3. **Accident Prevention**:
   - Helps drivers manage stress and regain focus to reduce accident risks.

## Step 3: Limitations and Future Improvements

**Current Limitations:**
- The system uses a fixed heart rate threshold, which does not account for individual variations due to factors like age, fitness level, or health conditions (e.g., hypertension).
- This generalization may lead to false positives or negatives, affecting the system's reliability.

**Proposed Enhancements:**
- Develop adaptive algorithms to adjust thresholds based on driver-specific baseline HRV data.
- Integrate additional sensors (e.g., accelerometers, skin conductance sensors) for multi-modal stress detection.
- Implement machine learning to improve accuracy and personalization over time.

## Step 4: How to Use the SmartDrive Alert System

1. **Setup the Device**:
   Follow these steps to configure and set up the SmartDrive Alert System in its wearable form:

#### Device Configuration
1. **Heart Rate Sensor Placement**: Attach the heart rate sensor to a comfortable location, such as the wrist or chest, using adjustable straps or adhesive patches. Ensure the sensor maintains consistent contact with the skin for accurate readings.
2. **Microcontroller Attachment**: Secure the microcontroller to the wearable framework, ensuring it is lightweight and positioned for easy access during use.

#### Software Installation
1. **Required Tools**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Library Dependencies**: Install the following libraries through the Arduino Library Manager:
   - `Adafruit Circuit Playground` for microcontroller support.
   - `PulseSensorPlayground` for heart rate data processing.
3. **Code Upload**: Open the project code file in the Arduino IDE, connect the microcontroller to your computer via USB, and upload the code.

#### Power Supply
1. **Portable Power Source**: Attach a lightweight battery pack to the wearable framework. Ensure the power source is securely fastened and does not impede movement.
2. **Safety Precautions**: Use insulated wires and connectors to prevent electrical shorts or discomfort during use.

#### Alert System Setup
1. **Sound and Light Notifications**: Position the sound buzzer and LED light on the wearable in locations visible and audible to the driver, such as on the wrist strap or near the dashboard if detached.
2. **Testing Alerts**: Test the alert system to ensure it activates appropriately when stress levels are simulated.

#### Wearing Instructions
1. **Proper Fit**: Wear the device so the heart rate sensor is snug but not restrictive. Adjust straps as needed for comfort.
2. **Skin Contact**: Ensure the sensor maintains uninterrupted contact with clean, dry skin for reliable readings.


2. **Monitor in Real-Time**:
   - The system continuously collects and processes HRV data while the driver operates the vehicle.

3. **Respond to Alerts**:
   - If an alert is triggered, the driver should follow the notification prompts to address stress or fatigue.
